# Complex-Wavelet-Inception-GAN-Audio-Synthesis
The adversarial audio synthesis started from the work of Chris Donahua et al.(https://github.com/chrisdonahue/wavegan), which aimed at the unsupervised audio synthesis. Following studies have used various strategies to improve the fidelity of generated audio, such as Andr´es Maraﬁoti et al.(https://tifgan.github.io/#S-E), Jesse Engel et al.(https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/gansynth)
