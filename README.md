# Complex-Wavelet-Inception-GAN-Audio-Synthesis
This is a project improving the quality of unsupervised audio synthesis. It is a github project of a unpublished manuscript.
## Introduction
The adversarial audio synthesis started from the work of Chris Donahua et al.(https://github.com/chrisdonahue/wavegan), which aimed at the unsupervised audio synthesis. Following studies have used various strategies to improve the fidelity of generated audio, such as Phase Gradient Heap Integration introduced by Andr´es Maraﬁoti et al.(https://tifgan.github.io/#S-E), IF-Phase learning proposed by Jesse Engel et al.(https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta/tree/master/magenta/models/gansynth), inverse transform of Melspectrogram to raw wave audio (https://github.com/descriptinc/melgan-neurips), etc. Using different approaches, we explored to improve the fidelity of generated audio, including complex-valued convolution, wavelet transform, and inception generator.
## 1. Complex-valued convolution for complex spectrogram
The learning representation of complex spectrogram can avoid scattering the information of phase. The complex spectrogram, however, can hardly be modeled by real-valued neural network. Introducing the architecture of DEEP COMPLEX NETWORKS (Chiheb Trabelsi et al.), we learned complex spectrogram directly.
## 2. Wavelet transform to replace short time Fourier Transform
The short time Fourier Transform is not flexible enough to filter audio features at different frequency scales. This is not a significant improvement in experiments, since the major problems are the quality of generation and phase recovery.
## 3. Inception generator to capture features at different frequency scales
Inspired by wavelet transform and inception network, we designed a generator architecture provides flexible-sized convolution filter to capture features at different frequency scales. The audio signal is a mixture of various foundamental waves and harmonic waves. Different foundamental waves are at different frequency ranges, and their harmonic waves are at their multiple frequencies. All these together are too complicated and twisted for a single-sized convolution to process. Therefore, we proposed to use multi-sized filters to generate waveform audio signal, just like an inversed inception network. This modification can boost the quality of generated audio drastically, following the direction of WaveGAN, without generating the intermediate spectrogram.
